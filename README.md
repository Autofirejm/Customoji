Forumoji is a project to remake existing Unicode emojis in the DjangoBB style, mainly intended for use on the Scratch Forums.

## Contributing
There are a few details to keep in mind when contributing emojis to the Forumoji project:
* Check the `/resources/forumoji` folder to make sure the emoji has not been contributed already.
* Make sure the emoji does not break any of Scratch's [Community Guidelines](https://scratch.mit.edu/community_guidelines/), as well as any other rules that have been laid out by the Scratch Team.
* Forumoji is only accepting emojis that actually exist; if it does not have a Unicode codepoint (U+XXXXX), it is not a valid emoji. A [complete list of valid emojis](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-list.html) can be found on the official Unicode website.
* Your emoji should be 15x15 pixels in size; this allows the emojis to fit in line with text on the forums.

## Scratch
Forumoji has a [topic on the Scratch Forums](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/557083/); this is where most discussion about the project takes place, including important updates from @lopste. Some contributors may opt to post their emojis on Scratch first before contributing them here.
